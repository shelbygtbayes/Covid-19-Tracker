                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<o:p></o:p><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
                &nbsp; Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<o:p></o:p><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
            </p>
            <p>
                <o:p>
                    At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.
